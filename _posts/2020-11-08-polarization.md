In the Physics of Nanostructures group in the Department of Applied Physics at TU/e, the physics that lies at the core of future magnetic data storage and processing technologies is being investigated [1, 2]. 
In conventional magnets (such as fridge magnets) there is one magnetic north pole and one south pole. The magnetization vector (which points towards the local north pole) inside the material therefore points in the same direction everywhere. However, in the systems that are studied in our group, the magnetization is not unidirectional, but can instead form complex 3 dimensional patterns and structures where the magnetization vector rotates on nanometer length scales. The exact size and shape of these structures is intricately connected to the physical effects that play a role at the nanoscale and hence by imaging and studying such structures we gain information about the nature of these effects. 
In our group we investigate such patterns using a technique called SEMPA: Scanning Electron Microscopy with Polarization Analysis. This technique enables measurements of the 3D magnetization vector inside a magnetic sample with nanometer resolution. The generated data consists of 2D images containing projections of this 3D vector field, that are mutually orthogonal. An example is shown in Figure 1. Currently, these data sets are analyzed manually which is a time consuming process that is prone to errors. In this project, the student will use machine learning to detect and identify physically relevant features in these data sets. A generative modelling approach could be used to disentangle the effects of experimental parameters on the measurements and provide more insight into the fundamental physics.
