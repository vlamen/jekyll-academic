title: Understanding Anatomy Classification Through Visualization
excerpt: "One of the main challenges for broad adoption of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models is the lack of understanding of their decision process. In many applications a simpler less capable model that can be easily understood is favorable to a black-box model that has superior performance. In this paper, we present an approach for designing DCNN models based on visualization of the internal activations of the model. We visualize the model's response using fractional stride convolution technique and compare the results with known imaging landmarks from the medical literature.

**Abstract** 
One of the main challenges for broad adoption of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models is the lack of understanding of their decision process. In many applications a simpler less capable model that can be easily understood is favorable to a black-box model that has superior performance. In this paper, we present an approach for designing DCNN models based on visualization of the internal activations of the model. We visualize the model's response using fractional stride convolution technique and compare the results with known imaging landmarks from the medical literature. We show that sufficiently deep and capable models can be successfully trained to use the same medical landmarks a human expert would use. The presented approach allows for communicating the model decision process well, but also offers insight towards detecting biases.
