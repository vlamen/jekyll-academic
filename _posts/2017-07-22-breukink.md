The goal of this research is to see if modern machine learning techniques can be used to improve predictions for costs of healthcare on an individual level. These predictions are then used to determine funds given to insurance companies, leading to a regulated competing market. This research mainly focusses on the costs of district nursing, as this is the area for which improvement is most likely to be feasible.
